# **Polysomnographic Markers of Slow-Wave Sleep Alteration in Alzheimer’s Disease**
# Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents a growing global health burden, with prevalence increasing rapidly due to population aging. In the United States alone, an estimated 6.9 million individuals aged 65 years and older currently live with Alzheimer’s dementia, a figure projected to rise to approximately 13.8 million by 2060 in the absence of effective disease-modifying therapies. Despite advances in symptomatic management, early diagnosis and mechanistic understanding of AD remain critical challenges.
Recent years have seen substantial progress in the application of machine learning–based approaches for early AD detection, particularly using neuroimaging modalities such as MRI and PET. These methods have demonstrated that subtle physiological and structural changes can be leveraged for early disease characterization. In contrast, polysomnography (PSG) remains comparatively underutilized in AD research, despite growing evidence linking sleep disruption, especially slow-wave sleep (SWS), to amyloid clearance, synaptic homeostasis, and neuroinflammatory regulation.
Notably, a recent systematic review identified 28 studies investigating PSG-derived sleep parameters in Alzheimer’s disease, of which 24 were suitable for meta-analytic synthesis, highlighting both the relevance of sleep physiology in AD and the relative scarcity of large-scale, integrative analytical approaches. This gap suggests an opportunity to apply modern computational and analytical frameworks, analogous to those used in neuroimaging, to PSG data in order to better characterize sleep microarchitecture alterations associated with AD.
In this study, we focus on slow-wave sleep (SWS) and its electrophysiological features in Alzheimer’s disease, comparing PSG-derived metrics between AD patients and cognitively normal controls using publicly available datasets. ***By combining sleep neurophysiology with data-driven analysis, this work aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of sleep-related biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease.***
