# AD-PSG
This project examines sleep-related biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease using polysomnography (PSG) and actigraphy data analyzed through machine learning. Motivated by the scarcity of experimental PSG studies correlated with AD, it focuses on slow-wave sleep regulation to identify relevant neurophysiological patterns.
